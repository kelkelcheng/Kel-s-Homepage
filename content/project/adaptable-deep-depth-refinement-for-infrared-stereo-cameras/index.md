While deep learning methods have achieved great results for stereo matching of color images, it is unclear whether they can be adapted to the stereo matching process of infrared images with projected textures. In this project, we propose a novel method for deep learning based depth refinement without the need of acquiring infrared image datasets, while being adaptable to any specific infrared camera. We also examine the effectiveness of infrared textures under the context of deep learning, and show that infrared textures are still useful for deep learning based stereo matching even though it lacks the color information. We provide a method to fuse the deep learning based estimation with the output of any traditional approach, which produces a depth map that is more complete and accurate.
