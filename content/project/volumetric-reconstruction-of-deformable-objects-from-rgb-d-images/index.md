Implemented a grid-based volumetric reconstruction method for deformable objects. As shown in the figure, the top-left is the original point cloud from a RGB-D image; the top-right is the initialized grid; the bottom-left is the fused point cloud after combining several images; the bottom-right shows the grid after deformation.
